# Quantum Internet noise handling as Perturbations

In this Project we attempt to simulate noise in an intermediate-to-large scale Quantum Internet application and handle it using $n^{th}$ order Quantum Hamiltionian time-dependent perturbations.

>This project remains a work in progress. While the results are promising they are experimental and are to be treated as such.


## Concept:

We express the noise of a system as a matrix. Using $1^{st}$ order quantum perturbation we create custom gates to approximate the total product to the identity matrix ($I$), making the total system fidelity approximately 100%.

## Unperturbed Hamiltonian:

```math
\begin{equation*}
H_{0} = -i
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1  \\
1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
```
Hermitian operator that governs the unperturbed dynamics. Physically, this could correspond to the interaction-free evolution of a two-level quantum system (like a qubit).

The evolution under $H_{0}$â€‹ alone would follow:

```math
\frac{d}{dt}\psi {t} = H_{0} \psi {t}
```

## Perturbation Example:

We used two time-dependent perturbation Hamiltonians were defined as:

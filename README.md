# Quantum Internet noise handling as Perturbations

In this Project we attempt to simulate noise in an intermediate-to-large scale Quantum Internet application and handle it using $ n^{th} $ order Quantum Hamiltionian time-dependent perturbations.

## Unperturbed Hamiltinian:

```math
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{equation*}
H_{0} = -i
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1  \\
1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
```
Hermitian operator that governs the unperturbed dynamics. Physically, this could correspond to the interaction-free evolution of a two-level quantum system (like a qubit).

The evolution under $ H_{0} $â€‹ alone would follow:

```math
\frac{d}{dt}\psi {t} = H_{0} \psi {t}
```
